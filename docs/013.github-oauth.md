# GitHub OAuth Apps

## [About OAuth Apps](https://developer.github.com/apps/about-apps/#about-oauth-apps)

OAuth2 is a protocol that lets external applications request authorization to private details in a user's GitHub account without accessing their password.

An OAuth App can be used as an identity provider by enabling a "Login with GitHub" for the authenticated user.

## [Creating an OAuth App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/)

1. Go to: GitHub - Setting - Developer settings - [OAuth Apps](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Click **New OAuth App**.

### Register a new OAuth application

- Application name: `Diary App in Local`
- Homepage URL: `http://localhost:8081`
- Application description: `Diary App Development`
- Authorization callback URL: `http://localhost:8081/api/oauth/authorize`

Click **Register application**.

## [Authorizing OAuth Apps](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/)

### Web application flow

#### 1. Users are redirected to request their GitHub identity

```bash
GET https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize
GET https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id={string}&redirect_uri={string}&login={string}&scope={string}&state={string}&allow_signup={string}
```

**Parameters**

- `client_id`: **Required**. The client ID you received from GitHub when you registered.
- `redirect_uri`: The URL in your application where users will be sent after authorization.
- `login`: Suggests a specific account to use for signing in and authorizing the app.
- `scope`: [Available scopes](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/#available-scopes).
- `state`: An unguessable random string. It is used to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks.
- `allow_signup`: Whether or not unauthenticated users will be offered an option to sign up for GitHub during the OAuth flow. The default is `true`.

#### 2. Users are redirected back to your site by GitHub

If the user accepts your request, GitHub redirects back to your site with a temporary `code` in a code parameter as well as the state you provided in the previous step in a `state` parameter. The temporary code will expire after 10 minutes. If the states don't match, then a third party created the request, and you should abort the process.

Exchange this `code` for an access token:

```bash
POST https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token
```

**Parameters**

- `client_id`: **Required**. The client ID you received from GitHub for your GitHub App.
- `client_secret`: **Required**. The client secret you received from GitHub for your GitHub App.
- `code`: **Required**. The code you received as a response to Step 1.
- `redirect_uri`: The URL in your application where users are sent after authorization.
- `state`: The unguessable random string you provided in Step 1.

**Response**

By default, the response takes the following form:

```json
Accept: application/json
{"access_token":"e72e16c7e42f292c6912e7710c838347ae178b4a", "scope":"repo,gist", "token_type":"bearer"}
```

#### 3. Your app accesses the API with the user's access token

The access token allows you to make requests to the API on a behalf of a user.

```bash
Authorization: token OAUTH-TOKEN
GET https://api.github.com/user
```

For example, in curl you can set the Authorization header like this:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: token OAUTH-TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user
```

### Redirect URLs

The `redirect_uri` parameter is optional. If left out, GitHub will redirect users to the callback URL configured in the OAuth Application settings. If provided, the redirect URL's host and port must exactly match the callback URL. The redirect URL's path must reference a subdirectory of the callback URL.

```bash
CALLBACK: http://example.com/path

GOOD: http://example.com/path
GOOD: http://example.com/path/subdir/other
BAD:  http://example.com/bar
BAD:  http://example.com/
BAD:  http://example.com:8080/path
BAD:  http://oauth.example.com:8080/path
BAD:  http://example.org
```

### Localhost redirect urls

The optional `redirect_uri` parameter can also be used for localhost URLs. If the application specifies a localhost URL and a port, then after authorizing the application users will be redirected to the provided URL and port. The `redirect_uri` does not need to match the port specified in the callback url for the app.

For the `http://localhost/path` callback URL, you can use this `redirect_uri`:

http://localhost:1234/path
