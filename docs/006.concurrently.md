# Concurrently

[kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently)

[Running the server twice](005.koa-router.md/#run-server) is complicated.

For shortcut commands, we use concurrently.

```bash
yarn add --dev concurrently
```

Add a script in `package.json`

```json
"scripts": {
  "server": "ts-node src/main.ts",
  "local": "ts-node -r dotenv/config src/main.ts",
  "start": "concurrently \"yarn local\" \"cd client && yarn start\""
}
```

## ⚠️ Warning

- Watch out for recursive execution.
- Don't set `"server": "yarn start"`.
- Dont' set `"local": "yarn start"`.
- Don't set `"start": "concurrently \"yarn start\" \"cd client && yarn start\"`.

## Run server

```bash
yarn start
```
